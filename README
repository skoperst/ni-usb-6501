The NI USB-6501 is a digital IO module for USB from National Instruments.
Unfortunately, their driver for Linux is excessively large (> 60M!) and
didn't work. So we decided to analyze the USB protocol and write our own
driver.

The result can be found in the directory c/.

For further details, have a look at doc/documentation.html.



NI USB-6218 is also a digital IO module for USB, it shared the command structure 
of the NI USB-6501,  however it is based on FPGA module which need to be programmed 
before every use.
Once started it will listen in 'bootloader' mode, and after programming it will
shut down USB and reconnect as the USB-6218 module.
